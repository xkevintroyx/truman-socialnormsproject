The Truman Platform 2.0
=======================
_The original version of The Truman Platform can be found here: https://github.com/cornellsml/truman_ 

Named after the 1998 film, The Truman Show, **The Truman Platform** is an open-source, complete social media simulation platform. It was developed as part of a joint effort by the [Cornell Social Media Lab (SML)](https://socialmedialab.cornell.edu/), led by former SML post-doc [Dominic DiFranzo](https://difranzo.com/), to provide researchers a community research infrastructure to conduct social media experiments in ecologically-valid realistic environments. Researchers can create different social media environments with a repertoire of features and affordances that fit their research goals and purposes, while ensuring participants have a naturalistic social media experience. 

This project and software development was supported by the National Science Foundation through IIS-1405634. Special thanks to everyone at Cornell Social Media Lab in the Department of Communication. 

Also special thanks to Sahat Yalkabov and his [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) project, which provided the basic organization for this project.
